Zarhus is an advanced Yocto-based Embedded Linux distribution developed by
3mdeb. It emphasizes security, adaptability, and strategic innovation, drawing
inspiration from chess, particularly the knight's tactical versatility. Zarhus
supports a collaborative community, inviting participation through [Dasharo
Matrix Space](https://matrix.to/#/#dasharo:matrix.org) and quarterly events.
Its development benefits from 3mdeb's expertise in Root of Trust, Secure,
Verified and Measured Boot, TPM, coreboot, UEFI, EDK II, Yocto, U-Boot, and
Linux across embedded platforms. The Zarhus Team has developed 87k lines of
open-source code supporting various hardware and security technologies. They
have also supported commercial partners in the creation of over 25 BSPs
integrating and developing various applications with a total code size of over
400k lines of code. Additionally, they have contributed over 17k lines of code
to various open-source projects essential for building and running Zarhus
products. Inspired by the elegance and strategic prowess of the Hungarian
"husz√°r", meaning knight in chess (Polish: skoczek), Zarhus brings a unique
blend of tradition and innovation to your embedded systems experience.
